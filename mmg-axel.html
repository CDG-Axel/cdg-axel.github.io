                    <h3>1. No Grinding</h3>
                    I hate grinding. So there won‚Äôt be anything like farming, mining, M7 runs, or Infernal Kuudra. Besides, those methods are often less profitable than mine.

                    <h3>2. Go Passive</h3>
                    It's awesome when money is earned with minimal effort. That‚Äôs why minions, forge, and composter are so powerful.

                    <h3>3. No Magic, Just Math</h3>
                    I‚Äôm not a math nerd, but I‚Äôm very familiar with MS Excel (or Google Sheets), and I often use it for calculations. It really helps avoid hopeless investments. I‚Äôve built Excel tables for calculators covering:
                    <ul>
                    <li>Composter</li>
                    <li>Forge</li>

                    Once upon a time, there was a guy who knew how to code ‚Äî that was me. I‚Äôve built tons of tools for Hypixel:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bazaar and AH price monitoring</li>
                        <li>AH search</li>
                        <li>Forge calculator</li>
                        <li>AH item estimator</li>
                        <li>Hoppity Hunt planner</li>
                        <li>Hoppity Hunt tracker</li>
                        <li>Character analyzer</li>
                    </ul>
                    I also have <b>tons</b> of Excel dashboards linked with my tools:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Top profit dashboards for Bits, Crafting, Forge, Garden Medals, Copper, Pests</li>
                        <li>Alert dashboards for AH and Bazaar</li>
                    </ul>
                    It‚Äôs not required, but it really helps save time and make money.

                    <h3>5. Master the Bazaar: Buy Smart, Sell Smarter</h3>
                    <p>It‚Äôs more nuanced than ‚Äúbuy low, sell high.‚Äù Take Skeleton Key forging. Normally, profit is minimal ‚Äî maybe 1‚Äì2M per key ‚Äî or even negative if you're careless with materials. But it is possible to turn it into a <b>massive</b> win - more than 15m per key.</p>

            <h2 class="border-bottom border-primary border-3">A Closer Look at the Specific Methods I Use</h2>

            <!-- Composter -->
            <div class="mb-4">
                <h3>1. Composter</h3>
                <p>The Composter is one of the most accessible and consistent money-makers, especially early on. Use <b>Seeds</b> (which account for ~95% of fuel cost) along with <b>Oil Barrels</b> or <b>Volta</b> as fuel. Seed prices are stable at around <b>74K per box</b>, while Oil Barrels or Voltas occasionally drop below <b>1,500 coins</b> ‚Äî a great time to stock up.</p>
                <p>Initial upgrades are inexpensive and significantly boost daily profits. With just the first 10 upgrades to <b>Composter Speed</b>, <b>Multi-Drop</b>, and <b>Cost Reduction</b>, you can already earn <b>~4M coins per day</b>, even when the <b>Compost Bundle</b> market is weak.</p>
                <div class="container-fluid border rounded border-info mb-3">
                    Never sell raw compost ‚Äî that‚Äôs a rookie mistake. I always wait until <b>Compost Bundles</b> reach <b>2.9M+</b> before crafting and selling. While this method requires daily investment (around <b>7.7M coins</b> with maxed upgrades), the returns are huge ‚Äî I often earn <b>over 19M</b> per day invested.
                </div>
                <p>Estimating upgrade costs and calculating payback periods isn‚Äôt hard. With smart planning, the Composter becomes a <b>low-effort, high-reward</b> source of income.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Minions -->
            <div class="mb-4">
                <h3>2. Minions</h3>
                <p>Right now, I use Inferno Minions as my primary choice üî•. They‚Äôre harder to manage than most setups, but the returns are unmatched. Legendary fuel is pricey, but it‚Äôs the only way to consistently farm Chili Peppers, Vertexes, Apexes, and Reaper Peppers. My daily fuel cost runs between <b>180M‚Äì210M</b> for 30 minions, depending on ingredient prices. I use <b>two Flycatchers</b> per minion and check them twice daily.</p>
                <p>In my setup, a <b>Beacon V powered by Scorched Power Crystals</b> is practically negligible in cost compared to the fuel and the minions themselves.</p>
                <div class="container-fluid border rounded border-info mb-3">
                    <b>Don‚Äôt fall for the 90M/day myth</b><br>Some content creators claim you can earn 90M a day with 10 T10 Inferno Minions ‚Äî that‚Äôs misleading. Before the <b>Habanero Enchantment</b> rework, minions were unstable and heavily reliant on RNG. On most days, weak Vertex output and no Apex drops meant you'd barely cover your fuel expenses. A rare double Apex drop could skyrocket your daily income to over 400M ‚Äî largely thanks to inflated Apex prices before the rework ‚Äî but that was the exception, not the rule. After the Habanero Enchantment was reworked, Inferno Minion income became far more stable due to the predictable Chili Pepper drops, which now account for ~60% of total profit.
                </div>
                <p><b>Yes, it‚Äôs expensive</b><br>My setup includes 2 T1, 20 T10, and 8 T8 minions ‚Äî with an estimated value of <b>12‚Äì13 billion coins</b>, thanks to the low Vertex prices. But you don‚Äôt have to go that far to start. Even <b>10 T3 minions with regular fuel</b>, or <b>10 T5+ with legendary fuel</b>, can kick things off effectively.</p>
                <p><b>Requirements</b><br>While anyone can craft fuel, you‚Äôll need <b>Demonlord Slayer III</b> to craft Inferno Minions and <b>Chili Pepper III</b> collection to unlock <b>Capsaicin</b> crafting (essential for legendary fuel).</p>
                <p><b>Daily Profit</b><br>For the past 20 days, my Inferno setup has brought in an average of <b>60M coins per day</b>, and over <b>90M/day</b> when including rare drops.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Forge -->
            <div class="mb-4">
                <h3>3. Forge</h3>
                <p>The Forge is far more complex than just pressing the ‚ÄúStart Forging‚Äù button. Let me walk you through my last experience, using <b>Skeleton Key forging</b> as an example. Before the Fiesta, I forged <b>300 Keys</b> ‚Äî a massive investment totaling <b>5.42 billion coins</b>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>192K each of Enchanted Tungsten and Umber Ore</b><br>I timed the market and paid only <b>7‚Äì10K</b> per ore ‚Äî total cost ~<b>3B</b>.</li>
                    <li><b>153K+ Enchanted Glacite</b> at <b>1.5‚Äì1.7K</b> each ‚Äî ~<b>250M</b></li>
                    <li><b>9,600 Fine Gems</b> (four types) at ~<b>18.8K</b> each ‚Äî ~<b>180M</b><br><span class="highlight">Tip: The best time to buy Fine Gems is right after a Fiesta ends.</span></li>
                    <li><b>900 Glacite Jewels</b> at <b>100K</b> each ‚Äî <b>90M</b></li>
                    <li><b>300 Mithril Plates</b> at <b>6‚Äì6.5M</b> each ‚Äî ~<b>1.9B</b><br><span class="highlight">I waited until the market approached my target price of 6M before buying any.</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>But it‚Äôs not just about the coins ‚Äî it‚Äôs also <b>a huge time investment</b>:<br>Total forge time: <b>4,830 hours</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>2√ó1200 Refined Ores: <b>0.7h each</b> ‚Üí <b>1,680h</b></li>
                    <li>600 Glacite Amalgamations: <b>2.8h each</b> ‚Üí <b>1,680h</b></li>
                    <li>300 Tungsten + 300 Umber Plates: <b>2.1h each</b> ‚Üí <b>1,260h</b></li>
                    <li>300 Perfect Plates: <b>0.35h each</b> ‚Üí <b>105h</b></li>
                    <li>300 Skeleton Keys: <b>0.35h each</b> ‚Üí <b>105h</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p>With <b>7 forge slots</b>, the effective forge time was:<br><b>4,830 / 7 = ~690 hours</b>, or <b>~29 days</b> of continuous work.<br>Realistically, it took me over <b>6 weeks</b>, since I‚Äôm not a robot and can‚Äôt instantly queue up the next task.</p>
                <p>I sold all 300 Skeleton Keys during the <b>first Cole Fiesta</b> for <b>33M each</b>, totaling <b>9.8B</b> coins.<br><span class="highlight">üü¢ Best time to sell? Almost always during the first Fiesta ‚Äî that's when demand peaks and prices surge!</span></p>
                <p><b>My net gain:</b> an incredible <b>4.4 billion coins</b>.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Craft -->
            <div class="mb-4">
                <h3>4. Craft</h3>
                <p>Crafting thrives on one simple principle: <b>cheap inputs, valuable outputs</b>. When done right, it can massively increase your returns by adding value through production.</p>
                <p>Before I got into higher-tier money strategies, I made decent profit just from <b>enchantment crafting</b>. Consider <b>Turbo-Wheat I</b> ‚Äî books regularly go for just 4‚Äì5k. Combine <b>16 of them</b> (totaling about 70k), and you get a <b>Turbo-Wheat V</b> worth <b>400k+</b>. That‚Äôs over <b>300k profit</b> on each craft ‚Äî not bad for beginner-level flipping. This approach also works with other books like <b>Corruption V</b>, where <b>Tier I books are often worthless</b>, and <b>Tier V sells for 350k+</b>.</p>
                <p>With time and experience, you'll develop a personal <b>recipe library</b> and start to understand how <b>material prices and product values react to in-game events</b>.</p>
                <p>Before the <b>Bobbin' Time III</b> enchantment got reworked, it was one of my most profitable crafts ‚Äî consistently bringing in <b>10 to 15 million coins per book</b>. My strategy was simple: <b>hoard key ingredients</b> like <b>Soul Fragments</b>, <b>Great White Shark Teeth</b>, and <b>Hunks of Blue Ice</b> during events when prices dropped significantly. Then, I would <b>cash in big</b> during <b>peak demand</b> ‚Äî especially during <b>Marina‚Äôs Fishing Fiestas</b>, when everyone scrambled for high-tier fishing gear.</p>
                <p>Nowadays I craft Habanero Tactics IV enchantment. My daily Chili Pepper income from Inferno Minions is around 1200, and I can earn 1200 * 135k = 162m just selling it. But better idea is to craft Habanero Tactics instead. I need additional materials to craft two books: 80 Chili Pepper (~10.5m via Buy order), 256 Brown Mushroom Blocks (~12.7M), Plasma and Rabbit Hides (~350k).</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Bazaar -->
            <div class="mb-4">
                <h3>5. Bazaar</h3>
                <p>When you dive into using buy and sell orders on the Bazaar, you'll quickly notice a common problem: players frequently outbid or undercut your orders almost instantly. Leave your listings unattended for too long, and you risk waiting ages for them to fill. To work around this, it‚Äôs crucial to assess the item turnover first.</p>
                <p>Activate <b>Bazaar Extended Statistics</b> under <em>Bazaar Settings ‚Üí Advanced Mode</em>, and check the <em>insta-buy/insta-sell in 7d</em> volumes and the <em>7d average price</em>.</p>
                <p>For example, the <b>Turbo-Wheat V book</b> shows around <b>950 insta-buys per week</b>. That means approximately <b>135 books</b> are sold per day. But sales aren't spread evenly. Since the Hypixel player base is largely made up of school-aged users, activity peaks in the <b>afternoon and evening</b> hours for <b>Eastern Europe and US time zones</b>.</p>
                <p>For most items, around <b>70% of sales</b> happen during a <b>12-hour peak window</b>. That means you can expect about <code>135 √ó 0.7 √∑ 12 = ~8</code> Turbo-Wheat V sales per hour.</p>
                <p>Like the proverb says, <em>‚ÄúA spoon is dear when lunchtime is near.‚Äù</em> <b>Spring (+25 FF bonus)</b> or <b>Finnegan‚Äôs reign</b> often cause demand for <b>Turbo-books</b> to surge ‚Äî and that's when fast flips can really shine.</p>
                <p>It isn't so obvious, but best time to buy sometime is falling prices. For example you've discovered than Enchanted Umber prices fluctuates between 8.5k and 11k. You may think time when you catch 8k price is your lucky hour, but it's not: most people being noticed the same and overbid will occur every 2-3 seconds. It's</p>
