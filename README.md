Initial target of project - helper utility for Idle Heroes mobele game.

You can contribute to this project by adding or fixing translations (js/ih-utils.js, js/gen_pages.mjs).
It would be helpful if you understand how Star Expedition guild points are counted; I currently have to hide the panel with these numbers due to inaccuracies (js/ih-utils.js, templates/sexp.html).
